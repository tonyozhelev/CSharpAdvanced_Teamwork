A simple project me and my team did for the C# advanced course. The team was created by 4 people and we had a few obstacles to overcome. We were all first getting into using github and it was quite a challenge to synchronize everything. We used some OOP basic design in order to keep the project easier to view, even though we were still unfamiliar with most of the OOP basics like encapsulation and inheritance. In the project we mostly dealt with string manipulation, but we also had some pretty tricky calculations to overcome in order for the game to be smooth and not have the plane drawings collapse with one another.
